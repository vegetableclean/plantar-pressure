"datacollect2" file is how I do after process my raw data which I tranform the raw data to the image type.
which can be achieved from "預處理.ipynb".
"隨機取樣照片的函式庫.ipynb" is the way how I increase the number of my data by using permutation to let three channel have different image but same category.
"finetuning_squeeze.ipynb" is how I do for model training.
