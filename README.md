# Plantar pressure index classification / medical image analysis



## About / Synopsis

* The project is about medical image analysis with plantar pressure
* Now we have about 200 volunteers plantar pressure data
* Project status: current state I am tring to do image classification to classify the different arch index
* Still in research

## Installation
python3 , anaconda , cuda 9

### Content
We have three important parts here, process the data, image augmentation and deeplearning for classification.
Since the medical image is limited, we have to figure out a way to increase our current data to have a better accuracy for model learning.
Thus, how we do in the project is deserved to look and experiment.
